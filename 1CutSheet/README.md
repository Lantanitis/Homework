    Breadcrumbs of progress of page
        (bootstrap)
    Map of pig that you can hover and display cuts
        image map generator (html)
        bootstrap hover options (css)
    Selectors that advance you once clicked:
        Pig Size to (JS)
        Pig Head to (JS)
        Appropriate (whole or half) pig menu to (JS)
            Items remain visible
            Have to have all items selected to move on (validation)
        Review Page of selections (JS)
    
    In the Pig Menu:
        Radios for each option cutting down on human error 
            (bootstrap/html/css)

        Whole Sausage Option
            2 radios allowed (bootstrap)
        Half Sausage Option
            1 radio (bootstrap)
    
*If time, mobile responsive -> not neccessary due to most people filling it out on a desktop or ipad
